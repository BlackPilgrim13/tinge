# 9 April, 2025 (In CFI Terrace)

- This meeting was a bug fixing meeting and a review meeting for the previous assignment. 
- DCs were asked to scour through literally each function to try to find and fix potential bugs.
- Post the clean-up we were able to fix all the issues in the [color_box](../../showcase/colour_box_1.png) render.
- We had full attendance in this meeting.
- DCs were given a break thereafter to enjoy the long weekend.
